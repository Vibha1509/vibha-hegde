I enjoy working with data, finding patterns, and using insights to make better decisions. My goal is to use my skills to solve real-world problems and help businesses work more efficiently.

I started my career as a Cyber Analyst at KPMG, where I worked with medical data and improved security and compliance for Sutter Health Hospitals. I created charts and KPIs to track important metrics and made reporting more accurate. I also led shift handovers and ensured smooth operations, reducing manual work and improving efficiency.

To expand my skills, I built an AI Resume Ranking Tool that helps recruiters shortlist candidates faster. By using AI, I reduced candidate selection time by 10 times and improved recruiter engagement with personalized emails. I also worked as an intern at Collins Aerospace, where I developed a Productivity Dashboard in Tableau to track shop floor performance. I automated daily data processing tasks using Python, making workflows faster and more reliable.

I am currently enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program, where I am learning more about Python, SQL, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I have also completed a No-Code AI course at Stanford, which helped me understand AI applications in business.

I enjoy using data to tell stories and solve problems. Whether it is building dashboards, automating processes, or analyzing trends, I am always excited to learn and apply my skills to new challenges.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LHbehi9r26JziFsDiTbtkb6-_djfhMqrSbAbrZa7pyw/edit?usp=drive_link ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
